# Sound Setup for CashFlow Comedian Notifications

## 🎵 Adding the Cha-Ching Sound

To enable the notification sound for the CashFlow Comedian system, you need to add a sound file to the Android project.

### 📁 File Location
Place your sound file at:
```
android/app/src/main/res/raw/cha_ching.wav
```

### 🎯 Sound Requirements
- **Format**: WAV file
- **Filename**: `cha_ching.wav` (exact name required)
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds recommended
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit recommended

### 🎵 Recommended Sound
The sound should be a short "cha-ching" or cash register sound effect that fits the financial theme of the app.

### 📱 How to Add the Sound File

1. **Download or create a WAV sound file** with a "cha-ching" or cash register sound
2. **Rename it to `cha_ching.wav`**
3. **Copy the file** to the `android/app/src/main/res/raw/` directory
4. **Rebuild the app** to include the new sound file

### 🔧 Alternative Sound Sources
- Free sound effects websites (freesound.org, zapsplat.com)
- Create your own using audio editing software
- Use a text-to-speech service to generate "cha-ching"

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- The file must be named exactly `cha_ching.wav`
- Only WAV format is supported for Android notifications
- The file should be relatively small (< 1MB) for fast loading
- Test the sound after adding it to ensure it works properly

### 🎤 Testing the Sound
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings → Notifications → CashFlow Comedian
3. Use the "Test Notifications" buttons to hear the sound
4. The sound will play when notifications are triggered

### 🚀 After Adding the Sound
The CashFlow Comedian will automatically use this sound for all funny financial notifications, making the experience even more delightful! 🎉
